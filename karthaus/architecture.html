                    <p>We design beautiful buildings and each one is different: a unique product of our relationship with the client and the site.  We have a deep interest in the way buildings are used and the materials they are made from.  Our architecture is not finished on the day the building opens, but only after years of inhabitation.  We have fun with the design process, so that our buildings are enjoyable to the people who live, work and play in them.</p>

                <p>We are currently on site converting a seven-storey mixed-use building on Tottenham Court Road, central London into high-grade speculative office space.  The reception centrepiece is a bespoke metalwork desk that becomes an artwork on the walls and ceiling, forming a chandelier above the entrance door.  Marketed to media companies, the aesthetic is contemporary industrial with a hand-crafted use of everyday materials: oiled mild steel, natural timber and concrete.</p>

             <!-- Project text -->
             <p>We have completed several small domestic extensions to Victorian houses.  A common problem is that the original buildings have high thermal mass, remaining cool in the summer whereas new extensions are often lightweight and heat up much more quickly, creating uncomfortable internal environments.  In this example we used wood-fibre insulation and a highly breathable, but airtight construction to make the extension feel and perform as part of the main house.</p>

                <p>In the 17th Century, Villeneuvette was a large-scale textile factory set in a hilly landscape in the south of France.  Pre-dating the industrial revolution, the factory was powered by a network of hydraulic channels that drove rudimentary machinery.  Our proposal was to re-establish Villeneuvette as a base for artisan crafts, combining small-scale enterprise with tourism.  An annual programme of events culminates in the 'festival of water' when the hydraulic channels are revealed through rivers of flowers running through the landscape.  </p>

             <p>Teaching remains an important part of our practice philosophy where architecture school acts as both a source and a testbed to push existing ideas and develop new ones.  We have taught professional and technical studies, sustainabilty and design and Roland Karthaus was formerly Programme Leader for the MArch (ARB/RIBA Part 2) course at the University of East London, as well as visiting lecturer at the Bartlett UCL in London and IUAV in Venice.

                <!-- Project text -->
                <p>Architecture takes a long time.  Live projects, usually temporary in nature, provide the opportunity to complete the cycle of a project in a much-compressed space of time.  Each year with students at the University of East London, we deliver a <a href="https://constructionweek2014.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> construction </a> project that is designed and built over a period of two weeks.  These have included shelters made from a single tree in the woods, a temporary pavilion in a public square and this year we will build a timber gridshell for the Spinney Nursery in Lambeth.  With <a href="http://architectse17.wordpress.com/" target="blank"> ArchitectsE17</a>, a voluntary group that we helped to establish in Walthamstow, east London, we run a public engagement project each year to promote interest in the built environment.  These included BoB - the 'Bus of Buildings' and 'Where in Wally' - a treasure map of people's favourite places in Walthamstow. </p>
