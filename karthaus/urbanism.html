                <p>We love cities and we're fascinated by the multitude of layers that make them tick.  Urban design is very different from architecture - its not just bigger, it requires a different way of thinking and working.  We have done a lot of urban design and masterplanning work and we don't do it as a loss-leader to win architectural work - its too important for that.  Most of all, urban design requires an even greater amount of collaborative working across a variety of disciplines, which is what we enjoy. Sometimes this role is combined with the project <a href="planning.html">planning </a>role and in many of our projects there is an overlap, but urban design is also an art in its own right. </p>

                <p>We undertake urban design assessments, including sustainability standards such as LEED ND and Building for Life assessments, drawing especially on our experience with housing estate regeneration and town centre redevelopment work.  We can also help to design site-specific urban design policies and design codes for large-scale projects.  The image shows Acton Gardens, an estate regeneration project in West London where we carried out a Building for Life assessment of the recently delivered phases and the remaining original streets so that a direct comparison could be made and lessons learned for later phases.</p>

                <p>We work with Social Life, a social research and action organistion as our skills are complimentary and often combined to understand how the design of a place and the people who inhabit it interact with one another.  Together, we were commissioned by L+Q housing association to assess a number of very different shared courtyards in their housing schemes.  Karthaus Design analysed the physical configuration, materials and environmental conditions, whilst Social Life interviewed people who used the courtyards and carried out observations of the spaces in use.  Overlaying these revealed useful information for the housing association which they are using to inform future developments .  </p>

            <p>We lecture widely on urbanism and have delivered lectures in Architects and engineers offices as part of their CPD, at Universities, charities and other organisations interested in how to engage better with their cities. In 2012 we were invited by the London Legacy Development Corporation to join an advisory group on the Queen Elizabeth park and in September 2015 we are speaking at the World Green Building Council conference in Stockholm.</p>

                <!-- Project text -->
                <p>As a member of <a href="http://ateliers.org/" target="_blank"> Les Ateliers Internationaux</a>, we have taken part in numerous professional workshops, examining live planning projects and making specific proposals for their improvement to the local authorities.  In 2009, Roland Karthaus was the sole UK participant in a workshop in Huludao, northeast China.  The brief was to design a new eco-city extension to the industrial conurbation.  Our team developed a set of both light and heavy infrastructures to clean the contaminated air and water and allow the gradual colonisation of the land in the most sustainable way given the site constraints and opportunities. Water is the biggest challenge here and specific plants are used as part of the urban landscape, both to treat the water and to make visible and enjoyable the processes of land reclamation.</p>

                <!-- Project text -->
                <p>In the 17th Century, Villeneuvette was a large-scale textile factory set in a hilly landscape in the south of France.  Pre-dating the industrial revolution, the factory was powered by a network of hydraulic channels that drove rudimentary machinery.  Our proposal was to re-establish Villeneuvette as a base for artisan crafts, combining small-scale enterprise with tourism.  An annual programme of events culminates in the 'festival of water' when the hydraulic channels are revealed through rivers of flowers running through the landscape. </p>

            <p>Roland Karthaus was project Architect at Andrew Wright Associates for the redevelopment of Clapham Park - an estate regeneration project of 3,500 homes. He led the design team from the outline proposal developed with local residents through a complex planning process, securing planning consent in 2005. This unique experience established much of the interest and expertise in urbanism of Karthaus Design.</p>
